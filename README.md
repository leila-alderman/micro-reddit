# Micro-Reddit

This Micro-Reddit project builds the data structures necessary to create a website with users, posts, and comments. The models, associations, validations, and tests can be experimented with inside `rails console`, but the project lacks any user interface.

[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav#project-2-micro-reddit) is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
